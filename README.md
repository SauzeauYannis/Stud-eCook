# Stud-eCook

We all know that Students are not the best in terms of cooking so that’s why we are happy to introduce you to the project named Stud’eCook, which is an application for students where you can share your best recipes easily and quickly. 

Our aims are to reduce the lack of abilities in cooking, develop the culinary culture of students and struggle against the student precocity. It is with these motivations that we develop this mobile application. This app is designed to help people to make easy cook recipes and at a smart price.

On the app the user can add a recipe where he has to indicate the price of the recipe, the time, the category, the utensils, the ingredients and the steps of his recipe. His recipe will be later visible in a “new recipes” tab which is here that appears on the recent recipes published by the community.
On our platform the user’s experience is led by a vote system. Indeed, each week, users will select the best recipe of the week, and this recipe will be in the hall of fame of its category.

This app is an Android only app and it will be available on Google Play. 
We think that this app is necessary in this time of precocity and social-distancing. We want to reborn the sharing between people and don’t lose the culinary abilities which are in loss for years.
We hope to create a student community who shares a lot of their cooking knowledge between them.
